# Example 14.2 (Standard error of the mean)

# In this example we illustrate the bootstrap by estimating the
# standard error of the sample mean and we will do it in the special case that 
# the underlying population is norm(mean = 3; sd = 1)

srs <- rnorm(25, mean = 3) # take a random sample of size n = 25 from the population

resamps <- replicate(1000, sample(srs, 25, TRUE),
           simplify = FALSE) # resample the data 1000 times to get 1000 resamples
                             # each of size 25

xbarstar <- sapply(resamps, mean, simplify = TRUE) # calculate the sample mean of
                                                   # each of the resamples

hist(xbarstar, breaks = 40, prob = TRUE, xlim=c(2,3.6))
curve(dnorm(x, 3, 0.2), add = TRUE) # overlay true normal density

sd(xbarstar) # estimation of the standard error of Xbar.

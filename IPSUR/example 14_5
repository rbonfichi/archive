# Example 14.5 The boot package in R

# In the "boot" package there is a "boot function whose syntax is
# boot(data, statistic, R)
# where:
# "data" is a vector (or matrix) containing data to bee resampled
# "statistic" is a function of two arguments that tells which statistic should
# be computed and how many resamples should be taken.

# using "boot" for the Standard Error of the Mean of Example 14.2:

srs <- rnorm(25, mean = 3)
hist(srs, xlim = c(0,6))
mean(srs)

mean_fun <- function(x, indices) mean(x[indices])

library(boot)
boot(data = srs, statistic = mean_fun, R = 1000)


# using "boot" for the Standard Error of the Median of Example 14.4:

median_fun <- function(x, indices) median(x[indices])
boot(data = rivers, statistic = median_fun, R = 1000)

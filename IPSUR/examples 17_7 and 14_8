# ExampleS 14.7 and 14.8 - Percentile interval for the expected value of the median

# these examples use the numeric vector "stack.loss" which contains 21 values
# Obtained from 21 days of operation of a plant for the oxidation of ammonia 
# to nitric acid.

# SOLUTION BASED ON A NAIVE SCRIPT

btsamps <- replicate(2000, sample(stack.loss, 21, TRUE),
                     simplify = FALSE) # list of 2000 numerical vectors each
                                       # resampling from original data "stack.loss"

thetast <- sapply(btsamps, median, simplify = TRUE) # numeric vector containing 
                                                    # the medians of the 2000 samples
mean(thetast) # mean of the medians

median(stack.loss) # median of the original sample (i.e., stack.loss)

quantile(thetast, c(0.025, 0.975))

# quantile visualization
P <- ecdf(thetast)
plot(P)
abline(h = 0.025, col= "blue",lty = 5, lw = 2)
abline(h = 0.975, col= "red", lty = 5, lw = 2)


# SOLUTION BASED ON "BOOT" LIBRARY

library(boot)
med_fun <- function(x, ind) median(x[ind])
med_boot <- boot(stack.loss, med_fun, R = 2000)
boot.ci(med_boot, type = c("perc", "norm", "bca"))

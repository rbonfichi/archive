# Example 14.4 (Standard error of the median)

# This example uses the "rivers" dataset which contains 141 values.
# The distribution is markedly skewed to the right (see histograms).

hist(rivers) # frequency histogram
hist(rivers, prob = TRUE, ylim = c(0,0.002)) # density histogram
lines(density(rivers), col="blue", lwd=2)

resamps <- replicate(1000, sample(rivers, 141, TRUE),
           simplify = FALSE)  # here we resample 1000 times the original 
                              # sample "rivers" getting 1000 sample each
                              # containing 141 values as "rivers" itself.
                              # "resamps" is a "list" of 1000 numeric vectors.

medstar <- sapply(resamps, 
           median, simplify = TRUE) # here we calculate the medians of the 1000 samples
                                    # and store it in the numeric vector "medstar"

sd(medstar) # standard deviation of the vector containing the 1000 medians = standard error on the median 

hist(medstar, breaks = 40, prob = TRUE) # histogram of medians
lines(density(medstar), col="blue", lwd=2)

median(rivers) # median of the original sample

mean(medstar)  # mean of the medians resulting from the 1000 resampling

mean(medstar) - median(rivers) # difference between the mean of medians 
                               # distribution and the median calculated 
                               # on the original sample

# PERMUTATION TESTING IN HYPOTHESIS TESTS

# This case study presents a problem related to a study on differing dosages of 
# a drug. Two groups were given different dosages: 300 mg (group X1) and 
# 600 mg (group X2). The goal is to test the null hypothesis that there is no 
#difference between these two groups.


# Original data
X1 <- c(284, 279, 289, 292, 287, 295, 285, 279, 306, 298)
X2 <- c(298, 307, 297, 279, 291, 335, 299, 300, 306, 291)

# Combine X1 and X2
combined <- c(X1, X2)

# Initialize a variable to store the differences in means
diff_means <- numeric()

# Number of iterations for resampling
n_iter <- 10000

for (i in 1:n_iter) {
  # Resample
  resampled <- sample(combined, size=length(X1))
  
  # Remaining scores
  remaining <- setdiff(combined, resampled)
  
  # Calculate the difference in means and store it
  diff_means[i] <- mean(resampled) - mean(remaining)
}

# Calculate observed difference on initial data
obs_diff <- mean(X1) - mean(X2)
obs_diff

# Draw histogram
hist(diff_means, main="Permutation Distribution", xlab="Difference in Means")
abline(v = obs_diff, col = "red", lw =2)

# Calculate p-value
p_value <- sum(abs(diff_means) >= abs(obs_diff)) / n_iter
print(paste("p-value:", p_value))
